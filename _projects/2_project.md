Do you like to feel like you're operating a starship where the writers have paid no attention to continuity? Do you like needless technobabble? Do you think sci-fi doesn't have enough mundane procedures and management of safety interlocks? Then Finite State is probably for you.

Finite State focusses on competency, communication, and good design for the operation of your starship.
