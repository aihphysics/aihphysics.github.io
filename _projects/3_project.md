Along with my little adventures into programming project, I'm a fan of a nice hardware task.

First up is my daily workhorse. A KBDfans Tofu60 (gen 1) build using a DZ60 ANSI RGB v2 board. Krytox 205g0 lubed Cherry MX Speed Silvers and some well preppred Durock V2 screw-in stabilisers make this the lightest and fastest board in the office.

Now we get to my go-to at home, and probably the pride of my collection, a Wuque Studio Ikki68 Aurora R1 in the charcoal colorway. The lower profile laser-etched DSA profile keycaps combined with the Gateron Black Box Ink V2's make this a board a pleasure to use. Krytox 205g0 on Durock V2's only serve to enhance this. I don't use this board for work, it just doesn't deserve that.

A recent build of mine I completed as a gift. Probably the most professional looking build I've completed. The Tiger80's TKL layout paired with ZealPC's 65g Zealio tactile switches, GPL 205g0 on them and the Wuque Studio OA stabilisers create possibly the most refined ergonomic experience I've produced to date. Complete with some Doubleshot PBTfans, a sleeper like this isn't to be slept on.
