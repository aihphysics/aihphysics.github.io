Along with my little adventures into programming project, I'm a fan of a nice hardware task.

    The Daily Driver.

First up is my daily workhorse. A KBDfans Tofu60 (gen 1) build using a DZ60 ANSI RGB v2 board. Krytox 205g0 lubed Cherry MX Speed Silvers and some well preppred Durock V2 screw-in stabilisers make this the lightest and fastest board in the office.

Now we get to my go-to at home, and probably the pride of my collection, a Wuque Studio Ikki68 Aurora R1 in the charcoal colorway. The lower profile laser-etched DSA profile keycaps combined with the Gateron Black Box Ink V2's make this a board a pleasure to use. Krytox 205g0 on Durock V2's only serve to enhance this. I don't use this board for work, it just doesn't deserve that.

A recent build of mine I completed as a gift. Probably the most professional looking build I've completed. The Tiger80's TKL layout paired with ZealPC's 65g Zealio tactile switches, GPL 205g0 on them and the Wuque Studio OA stabilisers create possibly the most refined ergonomic experience I've produced to date. Complete with some Doubleshot PBTfans, a sleeper like this isn't to be slept on.

In the works for a long time in terms of group buys and customs clearances, this Playstation themed board came together excellently. A KBDfans 67 v4 complete with bluetooth board, silicone and foam case inserts, and rear tape mode. 67 keys of ZealPC 67g Tealio linears with Krytox 205g0 paired with Durock V2 screw-in stabilisers lubed identically produces a uniform feel, and when paired with the brass plate, a supportive typing experience. The brass plate holding it all together does wonders for producing that weighty feel you expect with high-end boards. GMK Dualshot R2's finish off this board with a unique style you'll remember from the early 2000's.
