### Introduction
You should have some spare time for this.

### Equipment
* Roasting tin or pan or whatever.
* A soup container you can put on a burner.

### Ingredients
* Two sweet potatos, peeled and roughly chopped.
* One white onion rough chopped, one red onion finely diced.
* Red or orange or yellow pepper, rough chopped.
* Two red chillis.
* Good olive oil, salt, freshly cracked black pepper.
* Lime, coconut cream, fresh lime, a bowl(ish) of stock.
* Tomato puree.
* Garlic, 5 peeled, 3 minced. 1 thumb of ginger.
* One or two big red tomatoes, cut into 4-6 pieces each.
* A lovely tasty beer yum yum you should drink it while you cook.
* Spices: corriander powder, cumin powder, paprika, cayenne pepper powder, tumeric powder

### Recipe
1. The boring bit. Throw the rough cut tomato, onion, chillis, pepper, and sweet potato into your roasting thing along with the 5 peeled cloves. Cover well in olive oil, salt, and freshly ground black pepper. Roast for ages at about 473 Kelvin (do your own maths).
2. Shuffle the veg up every now and then and when the roast potato can be squished, start frying the finely diced onion in olive oil. After a while add the tomato puree, the ginger and the minced garlic. Let things start to soften.
3. Add the vegetable stock, the roasted veg and all the spices. Cook things in the mix for a bit and blend after about 15 minutes. Then add the coconut cream.
4. Stir in the coconut cream, add about 1/4 lime squeezed, and serve with bread that's actually good.
