### Introduction
I return to this dish about once a week. Why? It's probably the healthiest thing I'm capable of cooking.

### Equipment
* Two non-stick pans.
* A bowl or two to hold and separate things.
* Food processor or immersion blender.

### Ingredients
* 200g of spinach.
* 1 block of firm tofu.
* 1 large red onion.
* 1 red pepper.
* 1 Can coconut milk.
* Tomato puree.
* Fresh chillies.
* 3-4 cloves of garlic
* a good knob or two of ginger.
* Spices: salt, black pepper, cumin, tumeric, black mustard seeds.
* Olive oil.

### Notes
Serves 2. I won't legislate the rice and bread you should have here, go mad. The tofu, even though firm, can still be wet, and difficult to work with. If you haven't pressed a load of the liquid out before you start, you want to cook things carefully until it's started to dry out. I try do this on low leat, with less oil, and well attended to. When things stop catching, and they seem drier and more amenable to cooking evenly, then follow the main of the instructions below.

### Tofu Recipe
1. Cut tofu into small 1-2cm cubes.
2. Fry in olive oil, keeping adgitated such as not to stick or burn.
3. Add a healthy sprinkling of salt and cumin to this mix.
4. Fry until crispy and even.
5. You can also just eat these as a snack, they're kinda great and just full of protein.

### Saag Recipe
1. Cut up your onion and red pepper, start frying these in medium-low heat in the olive oil, along with some well-crushed garlic, chopped/crushed/pureed ginger, and the chillies.
2. After things have started to warm up, about 5 minutes, throw in your spinach, along with the tumeric, cumin, salt and a good pinch of MSG. Keep things warm and try adgitating the spinach towards the heat, it'll make it shrivel faster.
3. Pour in the coconut milk after the spinach has wilted, stir through, and let things start to simmer until reduced a bit.
4. You'll want to pull the peppers out now, they should be soft, and wilted too. Then, blend the rest of the Saag into a puree. 
5. Mix the peppers, tofu, and pureed saag together, serve with what you like.
