### Introduction
I nicked these of my friend Laura. She says she got these off her friend Bunny. I don't really know how far the rabbit hole goes.

### Equipment
* One non-stick pan.
* Pots for boiling.
* Bowls for mixing.

### Ingredients
* 1 Head of broccoli
* Pack of wholeweat or rice noodles
* Block of firm tofu
* Light soy sauce
* Dark soy sauce
* Sesame paste (not tahini)
* Bundle of spring onions
* Chinkiang vinegar
* Sesame oil
* A vegan butter of some kind
* Monosodium Glutamate
* Tumeric and paprika
* Fresh chillis, fresh corriander, and vegan sriracha mayo to garnish

### Notes
This is one that's been passed on a few times. I can tell you that it is most definitely inauthentic.

### Recipe
1. Make sure you've drained your firm tofu of any water. Heat some sesame oil and a good amount of vegan butter to bubble and in the non-stick pan. Crumble the tofu into this. Let this go and cook for a little, then add a bunch of tumeric and paprika in. Be sure to add more butter with this to ensure nothing dries out.
2. While the tofu gets started, chop up your broccoli heads and throw them into a pan of boiling water. These should be left until they're not al-dente per se, but a little tougher.
3. Now's the time to mix up the sauce. I tend to cook for a few people, so a couple table spoons of the soy sauces, one and a half tablespoons of the vinegar, a large pinch or two of the MSG, and about half the jar of sesame paste. Mix this with your preferred implement, it has a tendancy to pull together and thicken, dont mix it too far.
4. Next, bring another pot of water to the boil. Throw in your noodles when that's ready, these will only take 5 minutes or so. It's time to start prepping the rest.
5. Chop up your spring onions, corriander, and slice the fresh chillis. When the broccoli and noodles are ready, throw them in with the lightly browned but still soft shredded tofu. Add the sauce and the spring onions. Have fun getting this to homogenise, your arms will get sore. You can add a splash of water to make the sauce come apart a little, the heat will help too.
6. Grab some tongs and scoop as much as you'd like into a bowl. Garnish first with corriander, then your sriracha mayo, and then with the fresh chillis. Serve.
