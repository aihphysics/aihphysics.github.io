### Introduction
It's one pan I guess.

### Equipment
* One non-stick pan.
* Another if you're in a rush.

### Ingredients
* Gnocchi, fresh, packeted, gluten free, whichever. Just make sure it crisps up in butter.
* Cherry tomatos. Two varieties is best, get some rich red ones and some light sweet yellow-orange ones too.
* Butter.
* Italian hard cheese. Whichever. Finely grated.
* Garlic. Crushed and diced.

### Notes
You can do this in two pans if you're in that much of a rust.

### Recipe
1. Add an unhealthy amount of butter to the pan on low-mid heat, throw your gnocchi in there after it's melted. Toss and coat the gnocchi, you can add more butter as you cook. Keep agitating the gnocchi until it's got a good golden shell, some good brown crisp, and still has a soft potato inside. Once done set aside while you cook the sauce.
2. After halving, throw the cherry tomatos into the still now-unoccupied pan, reduce to medium heat. After these have just started to spurt their juice into the pan give good drizzle of olive oil over all the tomatos, a good covering of salt, and a few crunches of black pepper.
3. Give it a few more minutes to seep and reduce and get richer, then add a little bit of water, two or three cloves of smashed garlic, and the finely grated hard italian cheese, stir and mix all this together and let cook for 5 more minutes.
4. Mix the sauce and the gnocchi, serve immediately. A small grating of an aged cheddar isn't a bad idea.
