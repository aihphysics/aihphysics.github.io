### Equipment
* One non-stick pan.
* Sharpish knifes
* Blender of some form.

### Ingredients
* Small ciabatta or sourdough roll
* One avocado
* Olive oil and butter
* Fresh corriander
* Lime
* Salt and pepper
* Two eggs per sandwich
* Feta

### Notes
This is a lunch and breakfast thing. Eggs for dinner is a little odd, don't you think?

### Recipe
1. Start by halfing your rolls and toasting them under the grill. Keep an eye on them: ciabatta has a tendancy to curl as it toasts, it could end up more bowl than bread. While you're at it, start adding some butter and olive oil to your frying pan, and bring it to a nice bubbling level in mid-high heat.
2. You want to make a sort of half-guacamole. Scoop out your avocado and blend it smooth. If it's a little before ripe that's fine, slightly tough doesn't matter when you're turning it to paste. Throw in some freshly chopped corriander, some salt and pepper and a fresh squeeze of lime, maybe a third of a fruit at the most. I tend to skip the tomato and any onion here. You can throw a pinch of msg in here too.
3. Crack an egg into your bubbling oil and butter mix. There should be a fair bit of spitting. Keep yourself unburned while you spoon oil and melted butter over the top until you get a nice cover of your yolk. Sprinkle a little salt on the egg and remove from the pan when the edges start to curl and brown.
4. With your toasted bread and eggs ready, start to assemble. First a quick layer of butter on the bread, then a good table spoon of the almost-guacamole, spread out to the edges. Crumble some feta over the guacamole and layer your piping hot eggs on top.
5. You can stop there but if you'd like a closed face sandwich remember to butter the other side. If you're feeling _very_ risky try out some hot sauce on the eggs. Go light on any hot sauce, you don't want to hide any of other flavours under it.
