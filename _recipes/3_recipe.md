### Introduction
I was taught this one by a dear friend, on a cool Saturday morning in France, sometime August '22. Thank you, Victoria.

### Equipment
* A decently big non-stick pan. That's about it.
* Oh, a lid for it too.

### Ingredients
* 1 Large onion
* 1 red pepper
* 1 Can of good pelati.
* Tomato puree.
* 4 eggs
* Fresh corriander, flat leaf parsely, and red chillies
* 3-4 cloves of garlic
* Spices: salt, black pepper, cumin, paprika, black mustard seeds.
* Olive oil.
* Optionally, a bit of feta.
* Fresh sourdough, and some good cold butter.

### Notes
Serves 2. Makes your apartment smell great. Use however many chillies suits you. I usually go for one or two large red ones. If you fancy 7 scotch bonnets, I'm not going to stop you.

### Recipe
1. Cut up your onion and red pepper however you like. I prefer long strands of gooey veg in mine, you can have diced if you like. Chuck these in some olive oil that's at medium-low heat, along with the crushed garlic and your chopped chillies. Keep going until these are softened a little.
2. Throw in your can of pelati, and start breaking them up with a fork, then mix in the tomato puree, about a tablespoons worth. Remember to wash out the remnants from the can of tomatos and add the water from that as well. Wait for this to get to a simmer and wait a couple minutes.
3. Now's the time to add a tablespoon of the ground cumin and paprika, along with a bit of salt, and a good few cracks of black pepper. Add a healthy pinch of MSG about now too. Let things continue to reduce. You can stir if you like.
4. When the sauce has stopped being watery, wait a minute or two, then you start with the eggs. Clear a little spot in the sauce and veg, and crack an egg into it. You can spoon a little sauce back on the top of it if you like. Do this 4 times, then cover with the lid.
5. Wait however long you'd expect an egg to take in these conditions. It depends how you like your eggs, but they should poach a little in the sauce.
6. Uncover sprinkle a small amount of black mustard seeds, along with freshly chopped parsely and corriander leaves. If you like, crumple the feta over at this stage it gives a nice tang to the experience. 
7. Serve with the fresh buttered bread.
