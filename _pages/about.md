I'm Alina (she/her), I'm a PhD Student from Glasgow, Scotland, and I'm studying at Lancaster University. My research focusses on Quarkonium physics, more specifically, on extracting Gluon TMDs for the proton using charmonium final states. 

I'm involved in a number of projects, these include various design activites and my responsibilities as a Director at the Lancaster and Morecambe Makerspace.

My interests include photography, rocketry, programming and maker activities. Don't hesitate to get in contact, I'm most easily reached by email.

You can find my CV <a href="/assets/pdf/cv.pdf">here.</a>
